						In a shocking turn of events, it has been discovered that Adolf Hitler is still alive and well, and currently living in a secret underground bar in Argentina. According to sources close to the situation, Hitler has been in hiding for the past 75 years, biding his time and waiting for the perfect opportunity to make a comeback.

						Despite being well into his 120s, Hitler is said to be in good health and still as charismatic and determined as ever.

						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						The world will have to wait and see what Hitler has planned, but one thing is for sure: we have not seen the last of him yet.
